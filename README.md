# Multilingual-NER

Named entity recognition (NER) ‒ also called entity identification or entity extraction ‒ is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that automatically identifies named entities in a text and classifies them into predefined categories. Entities can be names of people, organizations, locations, times and more.

Multilingual NER incorporates identifying names, places etc in a sentence in multiple languages like Spanish, German etc.

In NER, we take text as input and then we classify the entities into  categories.

We have created a flask Web Application for NER in four languages - 
-English
-Spanish
-French
-German

Also it has feature to detect language of the input text.

We have used NLTK and spaCy for NLP purposes.

input.html and result.html are the input and ouput html pages respectively.

Flaskapp.py is the main code file.


Here's hoping you find it useful and extend it further.
